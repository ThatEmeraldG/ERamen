# üçúE-Ramen

This is a Front-End project assignment for my Human Computer Interaction course

Although not every section of the web HTML appears responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, this project was done in 1-2 weeks.

Check the initial design of the E-Ramen Project on [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/design/JmcCr1KlZB6XsZrOOjzykS/HCI---Project-ERamen?node-id=0-1&t=qyusVMiXPVqsFCzK-1)!
